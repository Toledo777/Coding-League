# Problem Runner Framework

## Requirements

This part of the project is made to run using [Deno](https://deno.land/),

Deno is an alternative JS runtime to Node that allows for runtime permissions to be controlled with much more granularity. This is what allows us to run untrusted code safely.

In order to get correct auto-complete and linting, please install the Deno language server extension as well.
