# Sprint 1

## What went well

- Robert: Entire Java application has been completed all in sprint 1
- Tasks are all good
- Communication:
    - Standups before each lab
    - We ask questions to each other a lot, both in person and on Discord

## What didn't go well

- Didn’t unit test APIs from the start as they were being made
    - Noah disagrees, need better balance for unit testing
    - Jaya suggestions: spend less energy testing 200 response, more of a focus on testing error responses
    - Jaya discussion: all of our routes are returning 200, not properly returning error codes for invalid/empty requests

## Changes for next sprint

What to do differently:
- Better response time to MRs (not always doing them as we ask for them)
- Better asynchronous communication for requesting a review on MRs

What to keep going:
- Standups, communication in terms of asking questions for clarity

Sprint 2:
- Scrum master: Robert
- Product owner: Noah
- What to accomplish for sprint 2:
    - User authentication
    - More pages (search page, profile page, etc.)
    - Submitting a solution, having it run, display results
    - Ensuring that bugs discovered in other teammates’ code should be communicated with them to some extent to make them feel valued
