# Web Development Project Proposal

Please copy this document to final project GitLab repository (**not the proof of concept repo**), in a branch named `proposal`. I will given you my comments in the MR.

(read the tutorials/gitTips.md!)

## Identification

**Student participant names:**

1. Gabriel Internoscia
2. Noah
3. Robert
4. Alex Vendramin
5. Matthew

The name of your team‚Äôs software company: **GNARM Inc.**

Official project name (can be changed later): **Coding League**

Project‚Äôs internal codename (cannot be changed later): **League**

*n.b: A software project usually has a codename which is immune to the vagaries of your company‚Äôs marketing department. For example, one notorious version of Windows was internally referred to as ‚ÄúLonghorn‚Äù and one notorious version of Mac OS was referred to as ‚ÄúRhapsody‚Äù. The latter-day tradition of naming versions of Mac OS after cats or places in California comes directly from the much older tradition of internal software codenames.*

*You should give your project a codename so that you can use it inside your software; it gives you an obvious namespace, a name for a singleton object, a prefix for whatever APIs you create, and so on. It should be something fun and memorable, but be careful, because names written in code are much harder to change than names invented by the marketing department!*

## Project summary

*In as few words as possible but without sacrificing accuracy, give a high-level summary of your project:*

Our project is a web application allowing users to partake in coding challenges, in order to improve and expand their own skills, or compete with others.

Dataset URL: 

[Problemset - Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset/)

*What will make your web site unique? For example, is there a specific feature that your website will focus on? Will you appeal to a specific set of customers? (Please note that if you don't have any great ideas, it's okay üòä It's mostly just to think about the real world aspects of your program!)*

## **What makes us unique?**

- Competitive ranking system similar to a ELO rating system
- Separate ranks based on different metrics
    - CPU time
    - Memory Usage
    - Lines of code
    - Best practices / Idiomatic code?
- Peer reviewing, Open discussions about problem solutions and suggest alternative methods
    - Learn from others and benefit from the experience of the group
- Friends leaderboard
    - Compete with friends to try and get high scores on specific problems
- Real time coding races using web-sockets (if we have time)

## User Stories

---

### User persona 1

**Persona description**: Competitive programmer

**Name**: John Doe

**Importance of users corresponding to this persona**: High (power users)

**Broad goal**: I want to show how much smarter I am than others.

User stories (give at least 2):

- As a competitive person, I want to be able to see a list of users who are better than me so that I can improve my score on problems they have done and beat them.
- I want to be able to critique other peoples code to make myself feel superior.

---

### User persona 2

**Persona description**: Casual user, learning to code by solving problems.

**Name**: Jane Doe (john‚Äôs mom)

**Importance of users corresponding to this persona**: Very important

**Broad goal**: I want to improve my coding skills and stay sharp in my old age.

User stories (give at least 2):

- I want to find programming challenges that will help me learn specific skills.
- I don‚Äôt want to always be competitive like my obtuse son, I‚Äôd like to be able to program without the pressure of being judged or ranked.

---

### User persona 3

**Persona description**: Junior Software Developer 

**Name**: Polly Esther

**Importance of users corresponding to this persona**: Very important 

**Broad goal**: I want to learn from others and get meaningful feedback on my code to improve my own skills.

User stories (give at least 2):

- I want to make sure the way I‚Äôm solving this problem is reasonable, but I don‚Äôt know anybody who knows the language I‚Äôm using to ask.
- I‚Äôm trying to learn language X but can‚Äôt think of anything to build with it to learn. I wish there was a set of problems that I could try to solve in slowly increasing difficulty to learn.
- I realized I benefited a lot from people helping me as I was learning to code. I wish there was a way I can give back by helping other people learn some of the things I now understand well.

## Mockups

*Insert one or more sketches/mockups of your project‚Äôs user interfaces here. After each mockup, write a list of which features from the table above are shown in each mockup and where they are represented. (You may also draw that directly on the mockup, with arrows.)*

*Please produce as many mockups as necessary to show as much of your application as possible.*

*n.b: If you submit a photo using a phone/tablet camera, please ensure it is as legible/clear as possible by taking the photo in good lighting and by positioning the camera directly above. Alternatively, you can use a scanner, or make your sketches in a mockup or vector drawing program such as Pencil or Figma.*
